Are you bad at financing because you're brainrotted?
Introducing Crocodillo Financinno, the Brainrot educational application for students to gain financial literacy.
## Inspiration
We were inspired by our lack of financial knowledge. 

## What it does
Mango is a gamified app that makes learning about money fun.
You "invest" in educational modules that look like stocks. Every time you play, an AI generates a unique, Duolingo-style lesson with different mini-games, so you're always learning in a new way.

## How we built it
Windsurf - For coding
Cohere - Creation of questions and simulations
MongoDB - Storing user profile data and course/module transcripts 
Auth0 - User accounts
Graphite - PR tracking/engineering practices

'## Challenges we ran into
Pivoting ideas - Having to pivot our original hardware idea to a new path needed us to be quick on our feet.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting an MVP done in 12 hours!
Having more than 10 financial modules implemented!
Working sleek frontend!
AI generated Duolingo style questionnaires, panels, and simulation questions.
Ability to learn while "investing" stocks with our gamified 
Auth0 enables seamless secure authorization to personal accounts and sensitive data.

## What we learned
We learned the importance of pivoting at the right time. 
We learned that teams function much better when everyone is on the same page.

## What's next for Crocodillo Financinno
Implement more training modules
