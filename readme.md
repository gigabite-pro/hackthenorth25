# 📈 StockUp  
*A gamified stock market where every “stock” is a financial literacy lesson taught through brainrot-style videos.*

## 🚀 Overview  
Finance is boring for most students — but TikTok brainrot? That’s sticky.  
**StockUp** makes financial literacy fun by turning money lessons into stocks you can invest in.  

- Every **stock = a financial topic** (e.g., credit scores, budgeting, ETFs).  
- To **buy a stock**, you spend coins, watch a brainrot-style explainer video, and answer a short quiz.  
- When you finish, the stock price drops for everyone.  
- Daily streaks, leaderboards, and battlepass-style unlocks keep students coming back.  

StockUp transforms money skills into a game — so learning finance feels like playing the market.
